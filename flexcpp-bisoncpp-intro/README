- exp1.yy merely shows reduction of a number to an expression.

- exp2.yy shows the construction of plus expression.

  on input 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5, it first reads all the numbers 
  and then starts constructing the expression.

- exp3.yy fixes the above problem by making + left associative.

- exp4.yy includes + and *.

  On input 1 + 2 * 3 it seems fine.
  On input 1 * 2 + 3 it does not seem fine.

- exp5.yy fixes the above problem.

- unambiguous-exp.yy shows how an unambiguous grammar can be used
  to avoid using precedences and associativities.
