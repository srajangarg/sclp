This directory contains the implementation of a simple parser that consists of three files: 
scanner.ll, parser.yy, and Makefile. The files show how to pass values from scanners to the 
parser.

flexc++ and bisonc++ create the files scanner.h and parser.h which are required to be manually
updated by adding some functions in them. If these files already exist, they are not over-written.
They are created only when they do not exist.
This manual intervention requires us to do the work in three steps. 
(a) In the first step, the scanner.ll and parser.yy scripts are processed without any dependency 
    on the scanner.h and parser.h file (because they do not exist and will be generated).
(b) In the second step, the  scanner.h and parser.h files are manually updated. 
(c) In the third step, the scanner.ll and parser.yy are processed with a dependency on the 
    scanner.h and parser.h file. Every time they are modified, the scanner.ll and parser.yy 
    should be processed again.
The Makefile provides commands for all the three steps.  The target all checks whether scanner.h
file exists and executes steps (a) and (b). If it does, the Makefile calls itself recursively 
for executing step (c). Otherwise it executes steps (a) and (c).
